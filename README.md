Deep learning on platform side requires lot of pre-processing on input images like converting images to RAW (RGB or BGR) (Planar or Interleaved) binary format . In this repo, I have written python functions for multiple options.  

1. To Convert a Video File to RAW Planar Binary format (uint8)
2. To read RAW Planar Binary Data and Display
3. To Convert a Video File to RAW Interleaved Binary format (uint8)
4. To read RAW Interleaved Binary Data and Display
5. To create RAW Planar Binary Output (uint8) from multiple images from multiple folder
6. To create RAW Planar Binary Output (uint8) from multiple image from single folder
7. To create RAW Planar Binary Output (signed-float32) from multiple image from single folder
